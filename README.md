# llm-policy-generation

This project involves creating an AI foreign policy assistant.


Retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) allows for optimization of the output of a large-language model (LLM) by allowing it to access information outside of its training database. This allows the capabilities of the LLM to be applied to new datasets and tasks. However, RAG is limited in its ability to answer high-level questions about a dataset. This project explores how, instead of using traditional RAG, LLMs can be supplemented with knowledge graphs to assist in foreign policy decision-making. Foreign policy is an area which requires a high-level understanding of multiple perspectives, global implications, and rich relationships between nations, which makes knowledge graphs better suited for it than traditional RAG.
